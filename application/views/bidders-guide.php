 <p class="aboutus-text"><span class="fontbld">What is AucJunction.Com ?</span></br></br>
AucJunction is auctioning Site which is a brand owned by “Shopemet Networks Pvt Ltd”.</br></br>
<span class="fontbld">How do I bid ?</span></br></br>
To bid in AUCJUNCTION.COM, you will have to be a registered buyer. For registration you
have to log into “https://www.aucjunction.net/bidderregistration” and click the button for
registering. You have to fill a form and submit it. Your user id and password will be mailed to
your registered email id. This will be required for bidding. Your login will not be activated and
you will not be able to bid unless you pay your Subscription fee . After the payment is made
your login will be activated and you will be allowed to pay EMD and bid for those Auctions for
which an EMD is paid.</br></br>
<span class="fontbld">How many auctions can I bid on?</span></br></br>
An EMD needs to be paid for the auctions which you would like to Bid. There is no limit to the
number of auctions you can bid. So long an auction is active you can bid as many as you like.</br></br>

<span class="fontbld">What is the difference between straight bidding and automatic bidding ?</span></br></br>
You can bid on an item by straight bidding or automatic bidding (automatic bidding is also
referred to as &quot;proxy bidding&quot;).</br></br>

<span class="fontbld">What is Straight bidding?</span></br></br>

Enter an amount higher than the current winning bid and click the bid button. Your bid will be
accepted.</br></br>

<span class="fontbld">What is Automatic bidding?</span></br></br>
Automatic bidding places bids on your behalf at pre specified increments. Simply enter your
maximum bid (the highest amount you are willing to pay), and the increment amount. For
example, if present H1 bid is Rs. 200 per unit say, and a autobidder bids Rs. 1000 as maximum
and Rs. 10 as increment, then system will record his bid as Rs. 210 keeping a track of
maximum Rs. 1000 and increment Rs.10. If any other bidder bids any amount above Rs. 210/- ,
then system will record autobidder H1 bid as Rs 1210 + 10 x no of minimum increments
required to exceed the other bidders H1 bid amount till the autobidder&#39;s maximum is reached.
One bidder can bid only one autobid per item at any time before the close of that lot.</br></br>

<span class="fontbld">What are the bid increments?</span></br></br>
Any new bid must be greater than the current high bid. The minimum additional amount you&#39;re
required to add on the previous bid is called the bid increment.</br></br>

<span class="fontbld">Can I cancel my bid?</span></br></br>
After you place a bid on the auction item page, you cannot cancel the bid. So before you bid, be
very careful whether you are willing to bid or you have the sufficient fund to purchase the item in
case you win the bid.</br></br>

<span class="fontbld">What is a reserve price?</span></br></br>
The reserve price is the lowest price the seller is willing to accept for the auction item. In fact the
seller puts reserve price for every item he posts before the starting of an auction.</br></br>

<span class="fontbld">How do I know that my bid was accepted?</span></br></br>
During the bidding process, you will see the highest bid on the Bid page. If your bid is the
highest, the page will show you the highest bid. (This doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;ve won the auction,

only that your bid is currently the highest bid. To win, the auction must close without any higher
bids.)</br></br>

<span class="fontbld">I&#39;ve been outbid! What should I do?</span></br></br>
You have to be vigil on the auction floor. Once you find that a bid has appeared which is higher
than the bid you made, you have to re-bid.</br></br>

<span class="fontbld">How do I ask the seller a question?</span></br></br>
You can email the seller. In fact it will be little required in the context of auction floated in
AucJunction site as you have to contact AucJunction Live Chat with queries on any auction.
AucJunction acts as a facilitator of its principal (seller) for conducting its auction.</br></br>
